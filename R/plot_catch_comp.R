#' @title Plot the spatial catch composition from the commercial catches as
#' 'square pie charts' using \link{mapplots}.

#' @description Plotting of spatial catch compositions at different levels of
#' aggregation

#' @param gran is a Numeric Vector of granularities required
#' @param logs is the fleet logs from \link{combine_logs}
#' @param fleets is a Numeric Vector of the fleets to include in the catch
#' composition plot
#' @param vessels is a Numeric Vector of the vessels to include in the plot
#' @param trips is a Numeric Vector of the trips to include
#' @param years is a Numeric Vector of the years
#' @param cluster_plot is a logical, determines whether also to run PAM cluserting
#' on  the catch compositions and plot the clusters spatially
#' @param clusters_k is the number of clusters to search for in the PAM
#' clustering algorithm
#' @param scale_data is a logical, whether to normalise the data before the
#' clustering

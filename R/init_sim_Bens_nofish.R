#' @title Initialise simulation
#'
#' @description \code{init_sim} sets up the general simulation parameters such
#' as number of tows in a day, number of days fished in a week, how often
#' species movement occurs and number of years for the simulation. It also
#' creates some vector and matrix structures which are used in the
#' \code{init_pop} and \code{init_fleet} functions.

#' @param n_years is an integar defining the number of years for the
#' simulation
#' @param n_tow_day is an integar defining the number of tows in a days fishing
#' @param n_days_wk_fished is an integar defining the number of days in a
#' calendar week that are fished (e.g. 5 (out of 7))
#' @param n_fleets is an integar defining the number of fleets in the simulation
#' @param n_vessels is an integar defining the number of vessels in each fleet
#' @param n_species is an integar defining the number of species in the
#' simulation
#' @param nrows Numeric integer with the y dimension of the field in
#' \emph{nrow * ncol}
#' @param ncols Numeric integer with the x dimension of the field in
#' \emph{nrow * ncol}
#' @param move_freq is an integar defining the duration (in weeks) between
#' spatial movements for the populations

#' @return is a list of lists, detailing the indexs and data formats necessary
#' for the simulation.

#' @title Go fish fleet 

#' @description \code{go_fish_fleet} applies the function \code{go_fish} to the
#' entire fleet with an lapply.

#' @param fleets_params is the parameter settings initialised from \code{_init_fleets}
#' @param fleets_catches is the DF initialised from \code{_init_fleets}
#' @param Pop is the population matrix for all populations
#' @param sp_fleet_catches is a list of spatial catches (as a Numeric matrix) for the fleet of each population
#' @param closed_areas is a dataframe with the x,y coordinates are any closed

#' @return is a list with the objects catch detailing the fleet catches and
#' catch_matrices detailing the spatial catches, to input to the delay difference
#' model

#' @examples None as yet

#' @export

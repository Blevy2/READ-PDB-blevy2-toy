#' @title Initialise spatial closure(s)
#'
#' @description \code{init_closure} sets up the parameters for spatial
#' closure(s) in the simulation.
#'
#' @param input_coords is a dataframe of x,y coordinates defining the
#' closure(s). If the temp_dyn are not static, the list should be multilayered
#' with the [[week/month]][x, y]
#' @param basis is a character string detailing the data used to define a
#' closure 'on the fly'. Can be \emph{survey} to be based on survey data,
#' \emph{commercial} to be based on commercial data, \emph{real_pop} to be
#' based on the simulated population. Not needed if coordinates defined.
#' @param rationale is the basis for any 'on the fly' closure. Can be
#' \emph{high_pop} for the areas of a highest population or \emph{high_ratio}
#' for the areas of the highest ratio of population 1: population 2. Not needed
#' if coordinates defined.
#' @param spp1 is the first population as basis for the closure. If rationale =
#' high_pop then that should go here If rationale = high_ratio, its the target
#' (high quota) population. Not needed if coordinates are defined.
#' @param spp2 is the second population when rationale = high_ratio, the lowest
#' quota population. Not needed if coordinates provided or rationale =
#' high_pop.
#' @param year_start is a Numeric indicating the first year the spatial
#' closure(s) shoud be implemented.
#' @param year_basis is a vector indicating the years of data the closure is
#' based on...Must be before \code{year_start}. If \code{NULL} then closure
#' will be calculated dynamically each year. 
#' @param closure_thresh is the quantile of catches or high catch ratio which
#' determines closed cells
#' @param sc is a Numeric indicating the scale of data to use for the closure,
#' e.g. if the data is aggregated to 2 x 2 cells, is 2.
#' @param temp_dyn is a character string detailing whether closures should
#' be temporally 'annual', or change 'monthly' or 'weekly'. 

#' @return is a list of parameter settings for the spatial closures which
#' serves as an input to \link{run_sim}.

#' @examples Not as yet

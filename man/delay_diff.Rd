\arguments{
\item{K}{is a Numeric vector describing growth.  Note:
K is transformed to rho with \emph{\eqn{\rho = exp{-K}}} for the model.
estimate of instantaneous fishing mortality (obtained elsewhere, via
\code{\link{find_f}} and \code{\link{baranov_f}} functions.}

\item{F}{is the weekly fishing mortality rate.}

\item{M}{is a Numeric vector of the instantaneous rate of natural mortality for the population}

\item{wt}{is a Numeric vector of the weight of a fish when fully recruited}

\item{wtm1}{is a Numeric vector of the weight of a fish before its recruited}

\item{R}{is a Numeric vector of the annual recruitment for the population in
numbers}

\item{B}{is the biomass of the population during \emph{\eqn{wk_{t}}}}

\item{Bm1}{is a Numeric vector of the biomass of the population in the previous week
\emph{\eqn{wk_{t-1}}}}

\item{al}{is a Numeric vector of the proportion of recruits to the fishery
in \emph{\eqn{wk_{t}}}}

\item{alm1}{is a Numeric vector of the proportion of recruits to the fishery
in \emph{\eqn{wk_{t-1}}}}
}
\value{
Returns the biomass at the beginning of the following week,
\emph{\eqn{wk_{t+1}}}
}
\description{
\code{delay_diff} implements a two-stage delay-difference
model with a weekly time-step after \emph{Dichmont 2003}. Given the starting
biomass, overall mortality and recruitment it returns the biomass in wk+1.

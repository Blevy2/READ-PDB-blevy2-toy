\title{Plot the spatial catch composition from the commercial catches as
'square pie charts' using \link{mapplots}.}
\usage{
plot_catch_comp(
  gran = c(20, 10, 5),
  logs = logs,
  fleets = 1:2,
  vessels = 1:5,
  trips = 1:20,
  years = 18:20,
  cluster_plot = FALSE,
  cluster_k = 5,
  scale_data = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{gran}{is a Numeric Vector of granularities required}

\item{logs}{is the fleet logs from \link{combine_logs}}

\item{fleets}{is a Numeric Vector of the fleets to include in the catch
composition plot}

\item{vessels}{is a Numeric Vector of the vessels to include in the plot}

\item{trips}{is a Numeric Vector of the trips to include}

\item{years}{is a Numeric Vector of the years}

\item{cluster_plot}{is a logical, determines whether also to run PAM cluserting
on  the catch compositions and plot the clusters spatially}

\item{scale_data}{is a logical, whether to normalise the data before the
clustering}

\item{clusters_k}{is the number of clusters to search for in the PAM
clustering algorithm}

  Bio = NULL,

}
\arguments{
\item{Bio}{is a named Numeric vector of the starting (total) biomass for each of the
populations.}

\item{hab}{is the list of Matrices with the habitat preferences created by \code{create_hab}}

\item{start_cell}{is a list of Numeric vectors with the starting cells for
the populations}

\item{lambda}{is the strength that the movement distance decays at in the
\code{move_prob} function}

\item{init_move_steps}{is a Numeric indicating the number of movements to
initialise for the population distributions}

\item{rec_params}{is a list with an element for each population, containing
a vector of the stock recruit parameters which must contain \strong{model},
\strong{a}, \strong{b} and \strong{cv}. See \code{Recr} for details.}

\item{rec_wk}{is a list with an element for each population, containing a
vector of the weeks in which recruitment takes place for the population}

\item{spwn_wk}{is a list with an element for each population, containing a
vector of the weeks in which spawning takes place for the population}

\item{M}{is a named vector, with the annual natural mortality rate for each
population}

\item{K}{is a named vector, with the annual growth rate for each population}

\item{spawn_areas}{is a list of lists, with the first level the population
("spp1" etc..) and the second the boundary coordinates (x1, x2, y1, y2) for
the \code{create_spawn_hab} function}
}
\value{
The function returns the recording vectors at the population level,
the spatial matrices for the starting population densities and the
demographic parameters for each population
}
\description{
\code{init_pop} sets up the populations spatial distribution
based on the habitat preference, starting cell and 'n' numbers of movements
for all populations in the simulation.

init_pop(sim_init = sim_init, Bio = c("spp1" = 1e6, "spp2" = 2e5), hab = list(spp1 = matrix(nc = 10,
runif(10*10)), spp2 = matrix(nc = 10, runif(10*10)), lambda = c("spp1" =
0.2, "spp2" = 0.3), init_move_steps = 10), rec_params = list("spp1" =
c("model" = "BH", "a" = 10, "b" = 50, "cv" = 0.2), "spp2" = c("model" = "BH",
"a" = 1, "b" = 8, "cv" = 0.2)), rec_wk = list("spp1" = 13:16, "spp2" =
